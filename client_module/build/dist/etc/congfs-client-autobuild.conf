# This is a config file for the automatic build process of ConGFS client kernel
# modules.

# --- Section: [Notes] ---
#

# General Notes
# =============
# To force a rebuild of the client modules:
#  $ /etc/init.d/congfs-client rebuild
#
# To see a list of available build arguments:
#  $ make help -C /opt/congfs/src/client/client_module_${CONGFS_MAJOR_VERSION}/build
#
#  Help example for ConGFS 2015.03 release:
#   $ make help -C /opt/congfs/src/client/client_module_2015.03/build


# RDMA Support Notes
# ==================
# If you installed InfiniBand kernel modules from OpenFabrics OFED, then also
# define the correspsonding header include path by adding
# "OFED_INCLUDE_PATH=<path>" to the "buildArgs", where <path> usually is
# "/usr/src/openib/include" or "/usr/src/ofa_kernel/default/include" for
# Mellanox OFED.


#
# --- Section: [Build Settings] ---
#

# Build Settings
# ==============
# These are the arguments for the client module "make" command.
#
# Note: Quotation marks and equal signs can be used without escape characters
# here.
#
# Example1:
#  buildArgs=-j8
#
# Example2 (see "RDMA Support Notes" above):
#  buildArgs=-j8 OFED_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/src/openib/include
#
# Default:
#  buildArgs=-j8

buildArgs=-j8


# Turn Autobuild on/off
# =====================
# Controls whether modules will be built on "/etc/init.d/congfs-client start".
#
# Note that even if autobuild is enabled here, the modules will only be built
# if no congfs kernel module for the current kernel version exists in
# "/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/updates/".
#
# Default:
#  buildEnabled=true

buildEnabled=true
